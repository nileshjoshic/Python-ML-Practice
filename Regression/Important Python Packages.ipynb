    "### Numpy:\n",
    "Anyone who uses python for scientific computing, uses NumPy <br>\n",
    "It's a third-party package, allowing us to work with multidimensional arrays (powerful way to organize and process data) <br>\n",
    "Fundamental library for manipulating larger chunks of information\n",
    "\n",
    "### PANDAS:\n",
    "Enhances NumPy further <br>\n",
    "It allows us to organize data in a tabular form and to attach descriptive labels to the rows and columns, not just numbers as it's with NumPy <br>\n",
    "In addition, Pandas is endowed with broad set of tools, facilitating our work with various data formats and missing data <br>\n",
    "Essential package, if we want to to DS with Python <br>\n",
    "When using Pandas, the data in which we read the csv file, will automatically get converted into a dataframe\n",
    "\n",
    "### Matplotlib:\n",
    "A 2D plotting library, specially designed for visualization of NumPy computations <br>\n",
    "Provides large set of tools, which allows us to adjust Graphs as per our requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "### SciPy:\n",
    "Numpy, Pandas and Matplotlib as part of the larger SciPy group of libraries <br>\n",
    "It's a Python ecosystem containing lots of tools for scientific calculations, suitable for the fields of mathematics, ML, Engineeting & more\n",
    "\n",
    "### Seaborn:\n",
    "Seaborn is a Python visualization library based on Matplotlib <br>\n",
    "It provides high level interface for drawing attractive statistical graphics <br>\n",
    "We will code using Matplotlib, but use the beauty & style of Seaborn delivers\n",
    "\n",
    "### Statsmodels:\n",
    "A package built on NumPy and SciPy which integrates with Pandas <br>\n",
    "We will mainly create regression and statsmodels as they provide very good summaries\n",
    "\n",
    "### scikit-learn:\n",
    "sklearn is one of the most widely used ML libraries <br>\n",
    "We will use statsmodels to create and discuss regressions, but we will also provide, the relevant code in sklearn <br>\n",
    "E.g.: statsmodels is the real deal, however, sklearn makes it easier to understand the real deal"
